# Doubly Linked List in C

This is an implementation of a data structure "doubly linked list" in C. The project includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and printing of list elements.

## Files

- `list.h` - Header file with structure definitions and function prototypes.
- `list.c` - Implementation of functions for working with the doubly linked list.
- `main.c` - Example usage of the doubly linked list.

## Compilation

To compile, use the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c list.c -o example
```

## Execution
After compiling, run the program with:
./example

## Operations
- Inserting an element at the beginning of the list
